Understanding React.createElement()
📌 Introduction
In React, React.createElement() is a method used to create React elements manually. Before JSX became the standard, this was the primary way to define React components.

📌 What is React.createElement()?
React.createElement() is a function that returns a React element, which React uses to build the virtual DOM.

Syntax:
React.createElement(type, props, ...children);
Parameters:
type → The type of element (e.g., "h1", "div", or a React component).
props → Attributes of the element (e.g., className, id). Pass null if there are no attributes.
children → The content inside the element (can be text or other elements).
📌 Example Usage
Using React.createElement()
console.log(React.createElement("h1", null, "Hi, welcome to React"));
Equivalent JSX Code
console.log(<h1>Hi, welcome to React</h1>);
📌 Output in Console
If you log the created element:

{
  "type": "h1",
  "key": null,
  "ref": null,
  "props": {
    "children": "Hi, welcome to React"
  },
  "_owner": null,
  "_store": {}
}
This is how React internally represents the element before rendering.

🚀 Why React.createElement() is Not Commonly Used in Modern React?
1️⃣ JSX is More Readable & Developer-Friendly
JSX is cleaner and more readable than React.createElement().
React.createElement() involves nested function calls, making complex UI hard to manage.
✅ Using JSX:

const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
❌ Using React.createElement():

const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, React!");
👉 JSX makes code more expressive and maintainable.

2️⃣ JSX is Transformed into React.createElement() Automatically
JSX is NOT native JavaScript, so React compiles JSX into React.createElement().
With Babel (or Vite/Webpack), JSX is converted before execution.
Example JSX:

const element = <h1>Hello!</h1>;
Compiles to:

const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello!");
✅ Since React automatically does this, there is no need to manually use React.createElement().

3️⃣ React 17+ and react/jsx-runtime Optimization
React 17 and later introduced the jsx-runtime, removing the need to import React in JSX files.
Earlier, every JSX file needed:
import React from "react";
But now, React automatically handles JSX compilation, making React.createElement() even less relevant.
4️⃣ Performance & Maintainability
JSX is optimized in modern React projects.
Writing direct React.createElement() code reduces maintainability, especially in large applications.
Example of bad practice with React.createElement():

const app = React.createElement(
  "div",
  null,
  React.createElement("h1", null, "Welcome"),
  React.createElement("p", null, "This is a React app")
);
✅ Better alternative using JSX:

const app = (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This is a React app</p>
  </div>
);
JSX is simpler, shorter, and easier to modify.

📌 When is React.createElement() Still Used?
📌 1. Custom React Renderers

When building custom rendering engines (e.g., React Native, React VR).
📌 2. JSX-Free Environments
If using React without Babel/Webpack, React.createElement() is needed.
📌 3. Debugging & Low-Level React Understanding
Useful for tracing issues inside React internals.
📌 Conclusion
✅ JSX is the standard in React for readability, maintainability, and performance.
❌ React.createElement() is not used manually because React automatically converts JSX into it.
🚀 Modern React (17+) has even further optimized JSX usage, making React.createElement() mostly unnecessary.
